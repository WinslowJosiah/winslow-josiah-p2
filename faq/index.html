			<h3>Is this some kind of joke?</h3>
			<p>Umm...kinda?</p>
			<p><strong>Gematrimax</strong> is not meant to be a very serious programming language. However, it is a <em>real</em> programming language; the interpreter works, the example programs work, and it is indeed possible to write your own programs. Whether or not you would want to is another story.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h3>How do I write and run these programs?</h3>
			<p>There are two ways to run programs written in <strong>Gematrimax</strong>.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Go to the <a href="../tio/index.html">Try It Online</a> page, type your program into the given textbox, and click Run. <em>(No installation needed!)</em></li>
				<li>Go to the Download page, download the given Python interpreter, and run a .gmx file with it. <em>(This requires you to install Python.)</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>As far as writing <strong>Gematrimax</strong> programs, check out the <a href="../docs/index.html">docs</a> section for a rundown of the commands and the way that programs are written. (Alternatively, you can try "running" a piece of regular text, and seeing what happens!)</p>

			<h3>Gematria? What's that?</h3>
			<p>Gematria is a system of turning words and phrases into numbers. While its origin is unclear among scholars, it was frequently used in Jewish culture, and it was likely influenced by the similar Greek system of isopsephy.</p>
			<p>The Greek system of isopsephy involved assigning the first 9 letters of the alphabet values from 1 to 9, then the next 9 letters from 10 to 90, and then the next 9 letters from 100 to 900. Hebrew Gematria uses a similar system (although its alphabet is shorter, and thus its numbers end at 400). Many proponents of English-language Gematria use a system where the ordinal position of each letter (A=1, B=2 ... Z=26) is multiplied by 6 (for some reason) and added together.</p>

			<h3>Why does this exist?</h3>
			<p>Why not? <a href="https://i.redd.it/3yaxkp4oqsz31.jpg" target="_blank">This</a> exists.</p>
			<p>In all seriousness, this exists because, for the <a href="https://mcaweb.matc.edu/winslojr/vicom128/a4/" target="_blank">third</a> <a href="https://mcaweb.matc.edu/winslojr/vicom128/final/" target="_blank">time</a>, I decided that the easiest way to create content for a class website project would be to create a complete programming language.</p>
			<p>(The professor who assigned this project is Mike Hunsicker, so he's also to blame here.)</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h3>Gematrimax programs are too hard to write!</h3>
			<p>Of course, why wouldn't they be? It's not easy to make English words have certain letter sums for purposes of writing programs. However, I have made a utility called <a href="../gematriabot/index.html">Gematria-Bot</a> which lets you enter numbers and commands, and gives you suggestions of words that will fit for a <strong>Gematrimax</strong> program.</p>
			<p>There is also an alternative syntax I created for the language, which I call <strong>Cheat Mode</strong>, that's much easier to understand and program in. You can use this syntax in the online interpreter by clicking the "Cheat Mode" button.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h3>Why did you call it Gematrimax?</h3>
			<p>I called it <strong>Gematrimax</strong> mainly for two reasons:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Programs written in <strong>Gematrimax</strong> are entirely controlled by their words' Gematria values. As such, the name represents something having a maximal quality of Gematria.</li>
				<li>In the system of English-language Gematria (where the ordinal positions of the letters are multiplied by 6 and added together), <strong>Gematrimax</strong> sums up to <strong>666</strong>. (No, really; try it out!)
					<ul>
						<li>Coincidentally, <strong>Gematria-Bot</strong> has the same sum.</li>
						<li><strong>Cheat Mode</strong> has a sum of 444 under this system, which is kinda neat.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>

			<h3>How do you pronounce Gematrimax?</h3>
			<p><em>geh-MAH-trih-MAX</em>.</p>

			<h3>Are there any practical uses for Gematrimax?</h3>
			<p>Let's <em>hope</em> there aren't.</p>
